/**
 * @brief      Connect to a pipe server and optionally start a background helper
 *             thread to read it.
 *
 *             The topic string should ideally be the full path in the file
 *             system where the pipe server publishes: e.g. /run/mpa/imu1/
 *             However, you can provide the short topic name (e.g. "imu1") and
 *             this function will expand this to the full path assuming it is a
 *             topic located in /run/mpa/
 *
 *             If you are subscribing to a topic being published outside of
 *             /run/mpa/ (for example Android doesn't have a /run/ folder) then
 *             you must specify the entire path beginning at root "/".
 *
 *             First, this sends the client-specific "name" string to the
 *             server's request pipe at topic_dir/request. The server will
 *             respond by opening a new dedicated pipe for this client at the
 *             location topic_dir/name
 *
 *             This function waits up to a second for the server to make this
 *             pipe. It is then opened with the O_RDONLY for blocking reads and
 *             its file descriptor is saved for reading by the user either
 *             directly or with the helper thread.
 *
 *             The easiest way to get data is to enable either a simple or
 *             camera helper read thread by passing in either
 *             EN_PIPE_CLIENT_SIMPLE_HELPER or EN_PIPE_CLIENT_CAMERA_HELPER as
 *             flags. This thread will be started in the background by this
 *             function and will sit in a blocking read loop until the user
 *             calls pipe_client_close(). Each time data is available to read,
 *             the data will be passed by pointer to a user-defined callback
 *             function set with the pipe_client_set_data_cb() or
 *             pipe_client_set_camera_cb() function.
 *
 *             When using the simple data helper, you will need to specify the
 *             size of the read buffer used by this helper thread with the
 *             buf_len argument. This length will be heavily dependent on the
 *             type and frequency of data you expect to receive. The cameras
 *             helper thread will allocate just enough memory for one camera
 *             frame abd the buf_len argument is ignored.
 *
 *             Alternatively, the user can disable the helper thread by not
 *             passing an any of the helper flags and read the pipe file
 *             descriptor manually. To retrieve this file descriptor, use the
 *             pipe_client_get_fd() function.
 *
 *             Additionally, this opens the pipe_DIR/control pipe with the
 *             O_WRONLY flag if the server has enabled a control pipe for that
 *             channel. Its file descriptor is saved to the control_fd[ch]
 *             variable for the user to send control commands to the server. The
 *             client can use the pipe_send_control_cmd() function as a helper
 *             to do this.
 *
 *             Add the PIPE_CLIENT_OPEN_PAUSED flag to claim and initialize the
 *             channel for the given pipe name and location without actually
 *             opening the pipe. This saves the need for opening then pausing
 *             the pipe if the intention is to leave the pipe closed after
 *             initialization for later use.
 *
 *             Up to 128 channels can be opened to receive data from the same or
 *             multiple servers. This channel number has nothing to do with the
 *             server channel. It is only a way to index and differentiate

/**
 * @brief      Set the size of a pipe for a given channel.
 *
 *             A client can (and should!) increase the pipe size in cases where
 *             they need more buffering. Servers may also increase the pipe size
 *             if they see fit.
 *
 *             Pipes behave like FIFO buffers and can store data until ready to
 *             be read by the client. Root can set the pipe size up to 256MiB on
 *             most Linux systems. Normal users can usually set the pipe size up

 *
 *             This function returns the new size of the pipe after attempting
 *             to set it to a new desired size. Usually the kernel will
 *             "round up" to the next exponent of 2 so you may get a pipe size
 *             that's larger than requested. If you request a size that's too
 *             large and the kernel rejects the request, then the pipe size will
 *             remain the same and that existing size will be returned. You
 *             should therefore error-check by seeing if the return value is <
 *             the desired size.
 *
 *             Since the kernel will round-up anyway, you might as well just
 *             request a nice even size, e.g. 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128, or 256Mib.
 *
