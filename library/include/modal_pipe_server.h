/**
 * @brief      Initialize an set up a single channel to advertize a specified
 *             topic.
 *
 *             The provided topic name can be a short name or a complete path.
 *
 *             A short name, e.g. "imu0", will be automatically expanded to a
 *             complete path "/run/mpa/imu0/" if the string does not begin with
 *             a "/". If you are on a platform such as Android that doesn't have
 *             a /run/ directory or you wish to put the topic somewhere else in
 *             the file system, then you can provide a complete path beginning
 *             and ending with "/".
 *
 *             This will create the complete topic directory including all
 *             necessary parent directories.
 *
 *             Up to 16 channels are supported for simultaneous use. This
 *             channel number has nothing to do with the client channel. It is
 *             only a way to index and differentiate between multiple open
 *             topics.
 *
 *             Within the complete topic directory this function will create a
 *             request pipe for clients to send requests to. This also starts a
 *             lightweight pthread to service the request pipe.
 *
 *             This will also create a "pid" pipe in the topic directory and a
 *             thread to service it. From that pipe, other users or clients can
 *             read the PID of the process that created the topic, allowing them
 *             to shut down or monitor the state of the topic. See
 *             modal-kill-pipe.
 *
 *             Extra features can be turned on/off with the flags field.
 *             Currently only one extra feature is supported: the control pipe:
 *
 *             SERVER_FLAG_EN_CONTROL_PIPE
 *
 *             By enabling the control pipe, an extra pipe is opened alongside
 *             the "request" pipe with the static name "control". Clients can
 *             send anything into this control pipe and the server can read the
 *             data via callback set by pipe_server_set_control_cb(). An example
 *             of this use case is the IMU calibrator app (a client) tells the
 *             voxl-imu-server to go into calibration mode by sending the
 *             "START_CALIBRATION" string into a control pipe.
 *
 *             SERVER_FLAG_EN_DEBUG_PRINTS
 *
 *             Enables extra debug info to be printed for debugging of the pipe
 *             interface.
 *
 *             SERVER_FLAG_EN_INFO_PIPE
 *
 *             Enables an extra "info" pipe where client can read static
 *             information. Set this information string with
 *             pipe_server_set_info_string().
 *

/**
 * @brief      Set the size of a pipe for a particular client.
 *
 *             You probably don't need to use this function! Set the default
 *             pipe size in the pipe_info_t struct when creating the pipe in the
 *             first place. This is only if you absolutely want to dynamically
 *             change the pipe size of a specific client after they subscribe.
 *
 *             A client can (and should!) increase the pipe size in cases where
 *             they need more buffering. Servers may also increase the pipe size
 *             if they see fit. Generally servers should do this through the
 *             pipe_server_set_default_pipe_size(int ch) function instead.
 *
 *             Pipes behave like FIFO buffers and can store data until ready to
 *             be read by the client. Root can set the pipe size up to 256MiB on
 *             most Linux systems. Normal users can usually set the pipe size up
 *             to 1MiB, but processes usually run as root on VOXL
 *
 *             This function returns the new size of the pipe after attempting
 *             to set it to a new desired size. Usually the kernel will
 *             "round up" to the next exponent of 2 so you may get a pipe size
 *             that's larger than requested. If you request a size that's too
 *             large and the kernel rejects the request, then the pipe size will
 *             remain the same and that existing size will be returned. You
 *             should therefore error-check by seeing if the return value is <
 *             the desired size.
 *
 *             Since the kernel will round-up anyway, you might as well just
 *             request a nice even size, e.g. 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128, or 256Mib.
 *
 *             e.g. to set the pipe size to 16MiB use size_bytes = 16*1024*1024;
 *
 * @param[in]  ch          channel to set
 * @param[in]  client_id   The client id
 * @param[in]  size_bytes  The desired pipe size in bytes
 *
 * @return     new size of the pipe or -1 on error.
