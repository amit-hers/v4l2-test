/**
 * @brief      Common interface for vio server-client communication
 *
 *             VINS and QVIO servers may offer different algorithm-specific
 *             interfaces but should also offer this common generic interface
 *             for simple applications.
 *
 *             The variable names in the data structure for describing
 *             translations and rotations adhere to the following naming
 *             convention for clarity and readability.
 *
 *             Translations are written as T_A_wrt_B meaning the translation
 *             (position) of the origin of frame A with respect to frame B.
 *             Rotations are written as R_A_to_B meaning a rotation matrix which
 *             rotates a vector in the coordinate frame of A to be represented
 *             as a vector in coordinate frame B.
 *
 *             The following coordinate frames are used:
 *
 *             VIO FRAME: Centered wherever the IMU was when VIO started and
 *             aligned with wherever the IMU was VIO started. This is NOT
 *             aligned with gravity and the user must make use of the provided
 *             gravity vector if they wish to align the VIO data to gravity.
 *
 *             IMU FRAME: Centered about IMU and aligned with the VOXL “common”
 *             IMU coordinate frame, NOT to the imu frame from any one specific
 *             chip since VOXL has multiple imus. T_imu_wrt_VIO and R_imu_to_vio
 *             describe the position and rotation of the IMU frame with respect
 *             to VIO frame. For a diagram explaining the VOXL “common” imu
 *             frame see https://docs.modalai.com/camera-imu-coordinate-frames/
 *
 *             CAMERA FRAME: Standard open-cv camera frame with X right, Y down,
 *             and Z out the lens. This relation is initially read from a config
 *             file but is optimized further in real time by the VIO algorithm
 *             allowing the user to make use of better estimation of the camera
 *             mounting angle to compensate for manufacturing tolerances.
 *
 *             VIO GRAVITY ALIGNED FRAME: Centered wherever VIO started with yaw
 *             aligned to IMU but roll/pitch aligned with gravity. VIO FRAME
 *             does not align with Z along gravity but with wherever the IMU was
 *             on initialization. If you application requires alignment with
 *             gravity then you can follow the example here:
 *             https://gitlab.com/voxl-public/voxl-vision-px4/-/blob/78feacef924ce64e4e1c4c3f3a8ae14d1b38630b/src/geometry.c#L321

/**
 * The overall status of the VIO algorithm is described with three different
 * fields. The primary ‘state’ field is used to check the overall state of the
 * algorithm. The ‘state’ field can be VIO_STATE_FAILED, VIO_STATE_INITIALIZING,
 * or VIO_STATE_OK.
 *
 * When ‘state’ reports VIO_STATE_FAILED, the error_code field is set. Similarly
 * to posix errno, the ‘error_code’ contains the last thrown internal error. If
 * state==VIO_STATE_OK then the value contained in ‘error_code’ is undefined and
 * can be ignored.
 *
 * While the algorithm is running normally and state==VIO_STATE_OK then the user
 * can monitor the overall quality of the position estimate with the ‘quality’
 * field. This is a unitless measure of the VIO quality that is always positive
 * and increases with more accurate pose estimates. This is mostly derived from
 * the covariance matrix but also takes into account the number of features
 * being tracked and uncertainties in the algorithm’s behavior while

 *             The data can be read straight out of the pipe read buffer, much
 *             like reading data directly out of a mavlink_message_t message.
 *
 *             However, this does mean the user should finish processing this
 *             data before returning the pipe data callback which triggers a new
 *             read() from the pipe.
