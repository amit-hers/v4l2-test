/**
 * This is the recommended location for pipes to be created. It is not enforced
 * or used anywhere in this library, it's just where we recommend putting pipes
 * for consistency. For example, the imu server would make two channels with two
 * directories in this base dir, one for each imu0 and imu1
 *
 * - /run/mpa/imu0/
 * - /run/mpa/imu1/
 *
 * The camera server would then share the base dir, making a new dir for each of
 * the cameras:
 *
 * - /run/mpa/tracking/
 * - /run/mpa/stereo/
 * - /run/mpa/hires/
 *
 * This base directory is chosen because it only exists in memory, not on the
 * disk. It is also NOT preserved between reboots, ensuring no remnants of old
 * pipes exist on startup after improper shutdown. It can also be mounted inside
 * of docker images to share pipe data in/out of dockers.
