/**
 * @brief      helper to make a new directory and all necessary parent
 *             directories. Returns success if folder(s) already exist.
 *
 *             This requires the directory string to contain a trailing '/'
 *             after the final directory. This is done to allow a full path to a
 *             file to be given and this function will only create the necessary
 *             directories.
 *
 *             For example:
 *
 *             _mkdir_recursive("/tmp/folder1/folder2/"
 *             _mkdir_recursive("/tmp/folder1/folder2/file1"
 *
 *             will BOTH create: /tmp/ /tmp/folder1/ and /tmp/folder1/folder2/
 *
 *             Neither will create a folder named "file1" as mkdir() would.
 *
 * @param[in]  dir   The directory string
 *
 * @return     0 on success, -1 on failure
